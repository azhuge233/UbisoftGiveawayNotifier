# UbisoftGiveawayNotifier
A CLI tool fetches free games info from Ubisoft giveaway page, sends notifications to Telegram, Email, Bark, QQ, PushPlus, DingTalk, PushDeer, Discord and MeoW.

Demo Telegram Channel [@azhuge233_FreeGames](https://t.me/azhuge233_FreeGames)

> Currently I'm using [this official page](https://store.ubisoft.com/us/free-games) to get Ubisoft's giveaway information. If you ever come across another reliable info source, let me know by creating issue.
> 
> ~~I don't believe Ubisoft will ever host a giveaway again.~~ ⬅ Ubisoft actually hosted a giveaway shortly after I updated this line.
